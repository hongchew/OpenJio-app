# OpenJio-app
## Description
This is the mobile frontend for IS4103 TT01 - OpenJio

Built with React Native

This will be an Android focused application with possible iOS release depending on time constraint and porting difficulties.

## Quick Start
Please set up your developer's environment following the React Native documentations: https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup

`npm install` or `yarn` to install node packages

`npm run android` or `yarn android` to run in Android emulator from Android Studio

`npm run ios` or `yarn ios` to run in xcode iOS simulator (macOS only)


There should be no additional configuration files necessary in order to run the emulations, please check your ANDROID_HOME path in .bashrc and/or .bash_profile (macOS users), or in the system environment for windows to ensure that they are pointing to the android SDK (directory found in Android Studio > SDK Manager).

Ensure that you have created an Android Virtual Device (AVD) running on API29 under the AVD Manager option in Android Studio as well.
